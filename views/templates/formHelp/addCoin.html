<template name="genesis">
When was the genesis block mined? The easiest way to check this is to seach on Google for a block explorer for this blockchain and go to block 0. In most block explorers you can simply type "0" into their search feature and it will find the genesis block. In some cases, the genesis block may have a unix timestamp of "0" which translates to 1st January 1970. In those cases, simply use block 1 instead.

<template name="premine">
Were coins sold or distributed before the public were able to participate in mining? Did the developers mine coins before telling anyone else about it? This is more of a "if it quacks like a duck it's probably a duck" question. For example Zcash has a 20% mining tax until the developers recieve 2,100,000 coins, thus their premine is 2100000.
</template>


<template name="maxCoins">
Is there a cap on the total number of coins produced? For example, Bitcoin is 21,000,000. If there's no cap. or if there's an inflationary tail, please input the total coins that will exist in the year 2050.
